# IGDTUW-KHOJMANDI
A frontend web application to streamline the process of finding lost and found items on the university campus.

## Problem Statement
### Current System Inefficiency
Students resort to using official college email groups to report lost and found items, resulting in confusion and inefficiency. The decentralized approach leads to chaos and hampers the ability of individuals to locate their belongings effectively.

## Proposed Solution
### Centralized Platform
Serving as a centralized hub for lost and found items, the website streamlines communication and retrieval processes. By eliminating the need for scattered email notifications, it promotes a more organized and connected approach to handling lost possessions on campus.

### Hassle-Free Experience
Designed to simplify the process of locating lost items, the website offers a hassle-free experience for students. With its user-friendly interface and efficient posting/searching mechanisms, it aims to alleviate confusion and facilitate swift item recovery within the university community.

### User-Friendly Interface
The website features a simple and intuitive login/signup page, allowing university students to easily create accounts. Upon logging in, users can seamlessly navigate between sections dedicated to reporting lost items and searching for found items.
